# Notes on this exercise

The weighted mean is not a very widely used calculation. Essentially, it involoves modifying the frequency of datapoints from a given data set to place more emphasis -
or weight - on a particular value. As a calculation and measurement, it's relevance is purely mathematical and it has little or nothing to do with collecting data in the
real world.
