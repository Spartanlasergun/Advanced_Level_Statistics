# Notes on this exercise

This exercise deals primarily with solving for the original mean and standard deviation of coded datasets

In general:

If a set of numbers $x_1, x_2, x_3,... x_n$ is transformed to $y_1, y_2, y_3,... y_n$  by a means of coding where

$y = \frac{x - a}{b}$

then $x = a + by$

hence $\bar x = a + \bar y b$

and $s_x = bs_y$


### Disclaimer: Some of the questions in this exercise appear to be intentionally misleading. The first question asks for solutions using a coding formula even though the raw datsets are given. The last three questions ask for solutions to the mean and standard deviations 'using a method of coding'. I'm not sure what is meant by this and the answers as are given in the text, reflect a typical mean and standard deviation calculation for a raw dataset. I am unlcear as to the intentions of the authors with respect to these issue.
