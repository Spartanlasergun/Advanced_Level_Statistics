# Notes on this exercise

This exercise deals primarily with solving for the original mean and standard deviation of coded datasets

In general:

If a set of numbers $x_1, x_2, x_3,... x_n$ is transformed to $y_1, y_2, y_3,... y_n$  by a means of coding where

$y = \frac{x - a}{b}$

then $x = a + by$

hence $\bar x = a + \bar y b$

and $s_x = bs_y$
