One of the main reason for using Jupyter Notebook for this question/answer archive is that its support for data visualization where stem and leaf diagrams are concerned is greater than most other alternatives. 

(Matplotlib uses a line plot to represent the leaf values and the redundant data is not represented by the graph making it inaccurate as a 
visual representation of the dataset.)

Note: While the 'stemgraphic' module gives a much better visual representaion of a stemplot than most other statistic modules, it does not 
support the plotting of interval data. Hence, while the stem and leaf diagrams are accurate, they do not actually represent the correct 
answers for most of the questions given in this exercise.
