# Advanced Level Statistics

Programmatic solutions to Exercises in the book: "A concise course in Advanced Level Statistics with worked examples - by J. Crawshaw and J. Chambers". Answers to questions for each exercise are given in a unique directory that is labelled according to the exercise numbers that are given in the text.

### Note:
Not all of the answers are accurate - this is because the solutions are meant to reflect the application of statistics as seen from a programming standpoint. This means that answers may often be more precise - or more vague where the tools available are less refined. That being said, the intention is still to provide as close an answer as is possible within reason, according to the requirements of the textbook itself. Some questions are neglected because of ambiguity and other issues. Typically, these reasons are given in the relevant notebooks.
