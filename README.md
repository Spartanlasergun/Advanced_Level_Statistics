# Advanced_Level_Statistics
Coding Solutions to Exercises in the book: "A concise course in Advanced Level Statistics with worked examples - by J. Crawshaw and J. Chambers"

### Note:
Answers to questions for each exercise are given in a unique directory that is labelled according to the exercise numbers that are given in the text. Not all of the answers are accurate - this is because the soultions are meant to reflect the utility of statistics as seen from a programming standpoint. That being said, the intention is still to provide as close an answer as is possible within reason, according to the requirements of the textbook itself.
