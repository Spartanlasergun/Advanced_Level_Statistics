# Notes on this exercise

The Calculations in this exercise are all relatively simple calculations of the mean. It does however revisit the topic of Histograms as was previously done in another
exercise. I feel that it is important to restate that though the textbook plots histograms using calculations of frequency density - the frequency density calculation
has been purposely neglected here, as the python matplotlib module does not natively plot histograms using that method.
