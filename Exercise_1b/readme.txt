The term histogram was coined by Karl Pearson, who in doing research involving 
historical statistics, thought that the histogram would be particularly useful
in such endeavours as it represented continuous data. Of course, there is nothing
in a histogram itself that makes it more so suited to the task of representing
continuous quantitative data than any other. However, this fact has misled many 
to beleive that the histogram is used primarily with reference to historical data.
