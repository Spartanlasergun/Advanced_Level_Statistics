# Notes on this exercise

This Exercise deals primarily with calculations of the Mean, Standard Deviation and Variance.

Just as in the previous exercise the expected forumlae for use are:

Standard Deviation --> $\sigma$ = $\sqrt{(\Sigma (x - \mu)^2) \over n} $

Variance --> $\sigma^2$ = $\Sigma (x - \mu)^2 \over n $

Alternative form of the standard deviation --> $\sigma$ = $\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma x^2}{n} - \bar x^2} $
