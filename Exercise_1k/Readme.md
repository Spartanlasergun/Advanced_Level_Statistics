# Notes on this exercise

This exercise deals primarily with calculations of the median and interquartile range for grouped datasets, along with creating cumulative frequency polygons and curves. There are no specific formulas other than the formula used to calculate the interquartile range; which is given by:

-----

$$ Interquartile \ Range = Upper \ Quartile - Lower \ Quartile $$

-----

The most complex operations involve plotting graphs and doing linear interpolation with scattered datapoints for estimating quartile values. Naturally, this means that the solutions arrived at may not necessarily reflect the answers given in the text. 

Other than this there isn't much that is complex. Whether the upper limit, lower limit or midpoints assoicated with the interval width should be taken when creating graphs of cumulative frequency is important and it is not very well discussed/explained in this part of the chapter. 

Note: For several of the questions, I made a different choice of boundaries than the soultions given to the exercise and consequently arrived at different answers.
