# Notes on this exercise

This exercise deals primarily with calculations of the median and interquartile range, along with creating cumulative frequency polygons and curves. There are no specific formulas other than the formula used to calculate the interquartile range; which is given by:

$$ Interquartile \ Range = Upper \ Quartile - Lower \ Quartile $$

Other than this there isn't much that is complex. However, the idea of whether the upper limit, lower limit or midpoints should be taken when creating graphs of cumulative frequency is important and it is not very well discussed/explained in this part of the chapter. For several of the questions, I made a different choice of boundaries than the soultions given to the exercise. These choices may not have been correct and the theory behind boundary selection need to be reviewed.
