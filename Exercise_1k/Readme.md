# Notes on this exercise

This exercise deals primarily with calculations of the median and interquartile range for grouped datasets, along with creating cumulative frequency polygons and curves. There are no specific formulas other than the formula used to calculate the interquartile range; which is given by:

-----

$$ Interquartile \ Range = Upper \ Quartile - Lower \ Quartile $$

-----

The most complex operations involve plotting graphs and doing linear interpolation with scattered datapoints for estimating quartile values. Naturally, this means that the solutions arrived at may not necessarily reflect the answers given in the text. 

Other than this there isn't much that is complex. Whether the upper limit, lower limit or midpoints assoicated with the interval width should be taken when creating graphs of cumulative frequency is important and it is not very well discussed/explained in this part of the chapter. 

Note: The author has made a unique and rather arbitrary distinction in the text between grouped and ungrouped data that to my knowledge is not generally accounted for in statistics. As I understand it, 'Interval Data' is its own class of data and is not further differentiated into any subgroup. This exercise does not reflect the need for this understanding, but it should be noted. Cumulative Frequency is the mathematical concept around which 'grouped' and 'ungrouped' data seem to contrive their relevance.
