# Notes on this exercise

This Exercise deals with calculations of the Standard Deviation and Variance.

The formula given for Standard Deviation is $\sigma$ = $\sqrt{(\Sigma (x - \mu)^2) \over n} $

The Variance is given as $\sigma^2$ = $\Sigma (x - \mu)^2 \over n $

An alternative form of the standard deviation is also given as $\sigma$ = $\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma x^2}{n} - \bar x^2} $
