# Notes on this exercise

This exercise deals with plotting histograms, frequency polygons and other basic statistical operations.

In plotting histograms, the frequency density is given by:

$$ f.d. = \frac{frequency}{class \ \ width} $$

Note: The module used to plot the histograms for this exercise normailizes the frequency densities to values between 0 and 1. This does not affect the visual plot itself, but the y-axis for the plots do not reflect the frequency densities as expected by the text.
