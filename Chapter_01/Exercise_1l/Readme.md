# Notes on this exercise

-----

This exercise deal with calculations of skewness given by one of the two formulae:

$$Pearson's \ Coefficient \ of \ Skewness = \frac{mean - mode}{standard \ deviation}$$

$$Pearson's \ Coefficient \ of \ Skewness = \frac{3(mean - median)}{standard \ deviation}$$

-----
The application of these formulae to the questions in this exericse is relatively straightforward. However, complexity does arise with a few questions that involve the determination of quartiles (and other statistical values) for grouped and ungrouped datasets. The key point to remember is that the quartiles for grouped data can only be determined by linear interpolation and estimation.
