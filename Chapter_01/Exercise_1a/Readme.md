# Notes on this exercise

The 'stemgraphic' module used for this exercise gives a much better visual representaion of a stemplot than most other statistic modules. However, it does not support the plotting of interval data and is severly limited in the ways in which it can represent the stem and leaf units. Hence, while the stem and leaf diagrams are accurate, they do not actually represent the correct answers for most of the questions given in this exercise.
