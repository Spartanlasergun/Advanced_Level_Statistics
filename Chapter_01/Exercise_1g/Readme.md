# Notes on this exercise

This exercise deals primarily with calculations of the Mean, Standard Deviation and Variance. It also deals intensively with algebraic proofs involving manipulations of the mean, standard deviation and variance.

Where the answers required are primarily algebraic proofs (rather than intensive calculations), I have provided a very brief overview of these proofs using markdown.

Just as in the previous exercise the expected forumlae for use are:

Standard Deviation --> $\sigma$ = $\sqrt{(\Sigma (x - \mu)^2) \over n} $

Variance --> $\sigma^2$ = $\Sigma (x - \mu)^2 \over n $

Alternative form of the standard deviation --> $\sigma$ = $\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma x^2}{n} - \bar x^2} $

## Other relevant formulae

Quadratic Formulae ---> $x$ = $\frac{-b \pm \sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)}{2a}$
