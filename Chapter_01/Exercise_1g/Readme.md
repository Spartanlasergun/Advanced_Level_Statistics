# Notes on this exercise

This Exercise deals primarily with calculations of the Mean, Standard Deviation and Variance. 
This exercise also deals intensively with algebraic calculations and proofs involving manipulations of the mean, standard deviation and variance. In addition to the
formulae mentioned above, it would also be important to familiarize oneself with quadratic equations - in particular, the quadratic formula is of specific relevance.

Where the answers required are primarily algebraic proofs (rather than intensive calculations), I have provided a very brief overview of these proofs - somewhat abrasively, and within boundaries of what is allowed in a pythonic comment. I suspect that these will ultimately be very unhelpful to those that really do want an answer - with this in mind, I feel obligated to say that in the context of the answers provided here, algebraic proofs are not relevant to practical programming and are better left to pen and paper in the real word. (My sincerest apologies).

Just as in the previous exercise the expected forumlae for use are:

Standard Deviation --> $\sigma$ = $\sqrt{(\Sigma (x - \mu)^2) \over n} $

Variance --> $\sigma^2$ = $\Sigma (x - \mu)^2 \over n $

Alternative form of the standard deviation --> $\sigma$ = $\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma x^2}{n} - \bar x^2} $

(See exercise 1f for an in depth breakdown and discussion of standard deviation and variance)
