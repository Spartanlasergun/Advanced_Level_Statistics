# Notes on this exercise

This exercise deals primarily with calculations of the median and interquartile range for grouped datasets, along with creating cumulative frequency polygons and curves. There are no specific formulas other than the formula used to calculate the interquartile range; which is given by:

$$ Interquartile \ Range = Upper \ Quartile - Lower \ Quartile $$

The most complex operations involve plotting graphs and doing linear interpolation with scattered datapoints for estimating quartile values. Since interpolation from the programmatic standpoint is more precise (and somewhat more arbitrary based on the type of interpolation function used) the solutions arrived at may not necessarily reflect the answers given in the text.
