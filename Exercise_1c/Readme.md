# Notes on this exercise

There is a formula given in this exercise that calculates the growth of the radius of a pie chart in relation to a growth of a population. The idea is that as the
poulation grows, the pie chart itself should become larger in diameter to represent that growth. The formula is as follows:

` r_1 / r_2 = (sqrt(F_1)) / (sqrt(F_2))`

r_1 is the radius of the initial pie chart

F_1 and F_2 are the population sizes
