# Notes on this exercise

Note: While the 'stemgraphic' module gives a much better visual representaion of a stemplot than most other statistic modules, it does not support the plotting of
interval data. Hence, while the stem and leaf diagrams are accurate, they do not actually represent the correct answers for most of the questions given in this exercise.
