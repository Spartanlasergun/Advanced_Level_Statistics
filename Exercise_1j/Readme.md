# Notes on this exercise

This exercise contains relatively simple tests involving cumulative frequency, the median, quartiles, and ungrouped datasets.

For a set of data that is arranged in order of size:

* The median is the value 50% of the way through the distribution
* The lower quartile $Q_1$ is the value 25% of the way through the distribution
* The upper quartile $Q_3$ is the value 75% of the way through the distribution
* The n<sup>th</sup> percentile, $P_n$ is the value n% of the way through the distribution
