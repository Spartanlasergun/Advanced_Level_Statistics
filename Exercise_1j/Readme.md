# Notes on this exercise

This exercise contains relatively simple tests involving cumulative frequency, the median, quartiles, and ungrouped datasets.

For a set of data that is arranged in order of size:

* The median is the value 50% of the way through the distribution
* The lower quartile $Q_1$ is the value 25% of the way through the distribution
* The upper quartile $Q_3$ is the value 75% of the way through the distribution
* The n<sup>th</sup> percentile, $P_n$ is the value n% of the way through the distribution


Note: The author has made a unique and rather arbitrary distinction in the text between grouped and ungrouped data that to my knowledge is not generally accounted for in statistics. As I understand it, 'Interval Data' is its own class of data and is not further differentiated into any subgroup. This exercise does not reflect the need for this understanding, but it should be noted.
