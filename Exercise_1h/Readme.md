# Notes on this exercise

This Exercise deals primarily with calculations of the Mean, Standard Deviation and Variance.

Just as in the previous exercise the expected forumlae for use are:

Standard Deviation --> $\sigma$ = $\sqrt{(\Sigma (x - \mu)^2) \over n} $

Variance --> $\sigma^2$ = $\Sigma (x - \mu)^2 \over n $

Alternative form of the standard deviation --> $\sigma$ = $\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma x^2}{n} - \bar x^2} $

(See exercise 1f for an in depth breakdown and discussion of standard deviation and variance)

## Other relevant formulae

This exercise also deals intensively with algebraic calculations and proofs involving manipulations of the mean, standard deviation and variance. In addition to the
formulae mentioned above, it would also be important to familiarize oneself with quadratic equations - in particular, the quadratic formula is of specific relevance.
